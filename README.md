# Lightpaint Live: Cables

[Lightpaint Live](https://lightpaintlive.com/) is a family of apps for realtime light painting. This iteration uses cables.gl and web tech. The idea is to make it easy to use (no app to install), and relatively simple to build on top of, even if you aren't a programmer.

## Development

Mostly, this site is just a wrapper around the cables export. It provides a webapp manifest to enable app installation and offline usage. Most of the feature development happens in the cables project. This repository has a few commands, just for pulling updates from cables, and running a local server to test things out before publishing them. 

- `npm run pull`: pulls the latest version from the cables.gl project.
- `npm run serve`: starts a local server.
